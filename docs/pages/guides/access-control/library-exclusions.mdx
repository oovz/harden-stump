# Library Exclusions

A user can be explicitly excluded from seeing a library. This is useful for hiding libraries that contain content that a user should not see, such as age-restricted content or content that is not relevant to them.

## Configure Exclusions

<Callout emoji="🔐">
	This functionality is gated behind the `library:manage` and `user:read` user permissions. To learn
	more about permissions, see the [permissions](/guides/access-control/permissions) guide.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Navigate to the library settings

Navigate to the library you want to exclude the user from and click on the `Settings` tab.

### Select `Access Control` in the sidebar

The `Exclusions` section is located towards the bottom of the settings page. It contains a multi-select dropdown that allows you to select the users you want to exclude from the library.

### Select the user(s) to exclude

Use the multi-select dropdown to select the user you want to exclude from the library. You can select multiple users if you want to exclude more than one user.

### Save your changes

Autosave is enabled, so any changes should take effect immediately. Any user excluded from a library will no longer have access to the library or any content within it.

## Secure Libraries

<Callout emoji="🔐">
	Secure Libraries use a different access control model. Instead of exclusions (deny-by-default), secure libraries use **access grants** (allow-by-default).
</Callout>

For Secure Libraries:

- Users **cannot** see the library unless they are explicitly granted access
- Access must be granted by the server owner using the System Master Key (SMK)
- Content is encrypted and only accessible after unlocking with a user's password

This provides stronger security than exclusions because:

1. Content is encrypted at rest (not just hidden)
2. Unauthorized users see no indication the library exists (404, not 403)
3. Even with database access, content cannot be decrypted without user credentials
